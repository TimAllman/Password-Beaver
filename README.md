Password Beaver
===============

THIS PROGRAM IS NOT READY FOR USE.

Password Beaver is a lightweight, easy to use generator of passwords that are hard to guess.
By default it creates passwords based upon random selection from the printable characters
of the ASCII character set. This can be expanded to use the full ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) character set.

The Beaver's passwords are intended to be used with a password manager as they are not
easy to remember. When generated, they may be copied automatically to the clipboard to
be pasted elsewhere.

The character set used can be modified by the user to omit, request or require
character classes (upper case, lower case, digits and punctuation and symbols).
As well, an arbitrary user defined set of characters can be excluded to satisfy a cranky
Web site ot to improve readability (e.g. "1" (one) and "l" (lower case L) can be hard
to distinguish in some typefaces).
