Password Beaver
===============

**Password Beaver** is a lightweight, easy to use generator of passwords that are hard to guess.
By default it creates passwords based upon random selection from the printable characters
of the ASCII character set. This can be expanded to use the full ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) character set.

This first release is for Linux only but porting to MacOS or Windows is built in to the design and
should be easy. (The author does not have suitable computers to create MacOS and Windows versions
at the moment.) As well, English and French localisations are built in.

The Beaver's passwords are intended to be used with a password manager as they are not
easy to remember. When generated, they may be copied automatically to the clipboard to
be pasted elsewhere.

The character set used can be modified by the user to **omit**, **request** or **require**
character classes (upper case, lower case, digits and punctuation and symbols).
As well, an arbitrary user defined set of characters can be excluded to satisfy a cranky
Web site or to improve readability. For example, "1" (one) and "l" (lower case L) or "0" (zero)
and "O" (upper case O) can be hard to distinguish in some typefaces).
