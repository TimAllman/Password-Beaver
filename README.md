Password Beaver
===============

THIS PROGRAM IS NOT READY FOR USE.

Password Beaver is a lightweight, easy to use and secure password generator. By default it
creates passwords based upon random selection from the printable characters
of the ASCII character set. The passwords are intended to be used with a password
manager as they are not necessarily easy to remember. When generated they may be
copied directly to the clipboard, ready to paste elsewhere.

The character set used can be modified by the user to omit, request or require
characters in the upper case, lower case, digits and punctuation and symbols 
subsets of the full character set. As well, an arbitrary user defined 
set of characters can be excluded to improve readability or perhaps to satisfy 
a cranky Web site. Of corse, the length can be set as necessary.
