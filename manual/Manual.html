<h2 class="western"><a name="about"></a>About the Beaver</h2>
<p>Password Beaver is a lightweight, easy to use and secure password
generator. It creates passwords based upon random selection from the
printable characters of the ASCII character set or optionally from an
extended ASCII character set. Unwanted characters can be arbitrarily
excluded if needed. Optionally, the password is copied to the system
clipboard so that it can be pasted where it is needed. 
</p>
<p><em>Password Beaver</em> creates a character pool based upon the
user's selection of options. The pool of characters starts as the
printable characters from either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-ASCII">ASCII</a>
or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">ISO-8859-1</a>
(the most common extended ASCII) character sets, modified by the
user’s selections. It can be modified to <b>omit</b>, <b>request</b>
or <b>require</b> characters from several groups. Currently these
groups are <a href="#upper">upper case letters</a>, <a href="#lower">lower
case letters</a>, <a href="#digits">digits</a>, <a href="#symbols">symbols</a>,
and everything else to which we refer somewhat inaccurately as
<a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>. Further, an arbitrary set of
characters specified by the user can be excluded. You may want to do
this to improve readability in case the password needs to be manually
typed or perhaps to satisfy a Web site which doesn't accept some
characters in its passwords. The <a href="#length">length of the
password</a> can be set with the minimum length of 8 characters and a
maximum of 99. 
</p>
<p>The generated passwords are intended to be used with a password
manager as they are not easy for most people to remember. This makes
them harder to crack because a dictionary attack is very unlikely to
succeed and a brute force attack will likely take a very long time.
Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large
pool of characters.

confusing characters O (upper O), 0 (zero), I (upper I), l (lower L)
and 1 (digit) are excluded. </font>
</p>
<h3 class="western">Selecting characters</h3>
<p>Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large
pool of characters. If the ASCII character set is chosen (i.e.
Extended ASCII is <span style="font-variant: normal"><i>not</i></span><span style="font-variant: normal">
</span><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">chosen)
there</span></span> will be 85 printable characters to select from
while selecting <a href="#extended">Extended ASCII</a> (usually
referred to as ISO-8859-1 or Latin 1) will give 155 possible
characters.</p>
<p>However, a program or Web site that requires a password may not
accept all possible characters or it may set some requirements such
as requiring at least one upper case letter, one digit and one
punctuation character. Using the top check boxes, it is possible to
exclude, allow or require the following groups of characters: <a href="#upper">upper
case letters</a>, <a href="#lower">lower case letters</a>, <a href="#digits">digits</a>,
<a href="#symbols">symbols</a> and <a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>.
These check boxes have three states. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the checkbox is <i>unchecked</i>,
	that group of characters will be <strong>excluded</strong> from the
	character pool. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it is <i>fully checked</i> at
	least one character from the group will be <b>required</b>.</p>
	<li><p>If it is <i>partly checked</i>, characters from that group
	are <b>requested</b><span style="font-weight: normal">. They may</span>
	appear in the password or they may not.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="exclude"></a>Exclude</h3>
<p>You may exclude certain characters arbitrarily from the character
pool. It may be that a Web site does not accept some characters,
usually those in the punctuation group. Or, you may wish to avoid
characters that are easily confused such as I (upper I) and l (lower
L). Enter the characters in the <b>Exclude</b> <span style="font-weight: normal">text</span>
editor.</p>
<h3 class="western">Pool size</h3>
<p>This is the current size of the character pool from which
passwords are taken and changes as character groups are selected and
as some are excluded. This field is for information only.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="passwordlen"></a>Length</h3>
<p>The length of the password can be changed here. The allowed range
is 8 to 50 characters. The default length of 16 is a good choice for
most uses. 
</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="clipboard"></a>Copy to clipboard</h3>
<p>The default behaviour is to copy the password to the system
clipboard as soon as it is generated. Turn this off if you do not
want to do this. The text can be selected with the mouse and copied
if desired.</p>
<h2 class="western">Configurations</h2>
<p>Password Beaver maintains a database of configurations to simplify
creating passwords for sites with particular requirements. In the
Configurations section there is a combo-box allows you to select sets
of options by name and to enter names for new sets of options, a
small indicator to remind you when the options have been modified but
not saved and two push buttons labelled ‘Save’ and ‘Delete’.</p>
<p>When Password Beaver is first started it loads a default
configuration named “Default”. This configuration cannot be
modified, meaning that you cannot save or delete it. However, the
name can be changed and the configuration can be saved under this new
name.</p>
<p>To the right of the combo box is a small parallelogram shaped
widget that indicates, that either</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li><p>there is no option set with the name shown in the editor or 
	</p>
	<li><p>that there is an entry in the database with that name but the
	stored options are different from those shown.</p>
	<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 115%; background: transparent; page-break-before: auto">
	If either a) or b) are true the widget is filled with colour.
	Otherwise it is drawn in outline.</p>
	<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 115%; background: transparent">
	Pressing the ‘Save’ push button will store the data by creating
	a new entry if one with the current name does not exist or by
	overwriting the stored options with the new ones. The ‘Delete’
	push button will remove the named set of options from the database.</p>
</ol>
<p>Note that the ‘Save’ and ‘Delete’ push buttons are enabled
and disabled depending upon whether either operation can be done. In
particular, they enforce the read only status of the ‘Default’
entry. If ‘Default’ is the current item, neither both push
buttons are disabled, even if the widget is lit up because you have
changed the options. If you wish to save the new options, type in a
new name and save the options with that.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="password"></a>Password</h2>
<p>This field is read only and contains the last password that was
generated. If you don't like it for some reason generate another.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="entropy"></a>Entropy</h2>
<p>The entropy of the password is a measure of how many guesses would
be necessary to guess it. Specifically, it is <code class="western">log</code><code class="western"><sub>2</sub></code><code class="western">(n)
</code>where <code class="western">n </code>is the number of possible
passwords given the password length and the character pool size. This
is described in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_password_generator#Type_and_strength_of_password_generated" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Password strength</h2>
<p>A good password is hard to guess.
