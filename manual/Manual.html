<h2><a name="about">About the Beaver</a></h2>
<p>
    Password Beaver is a lightweight, easy to use and secure password
    generator. It creates passwords based upon random
    selection from the printable characters of the ASCII character set or
    optionally from an extended ASCII character set. Unwanted characters
    can be arbitrarily excluded from the the source pool of characters
    as well. Optionally, the password is copied to the system clipboard so that
    it can be pasted where it is needed.
</p>
<p>
    The program works by first creating a character pool based upon the user's selection
    of options. The pool of characters starts as the printable characters from either the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-ASCII">ASCII</a> or the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">ISO-8859-1</a>
    (the most common ASCII extension) character sets.
    It can be modified by the user to <b>omit</b>,
    <b>request</b> or <b>require</b> characters from several groups. Currently
    these are
    <a href="#upper">upper case letters</a>,
    <a href="#lower">lower caseletters</a>,
    <a href="#digits">digits</a>,
    <a href="#symbols">symbols</a>,
    and everything else which we refer to somewhat inaccurately as
    <a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>.
    Further, an arbitrary user defined set of
    characters can be excluded. You may want to do this to improve readability in
    case the password needs to be manually copied or perhaps to satisfy a Web site
    which doesn't accept some characters in its passwords.
    The <a href="#length">length of the password</a> can be set as necessary.
</p>

<p>
    The passwords are intended to be used with a password manager as they
    are not easy for most people to remember. This makes them harder to crack
    because a dictionary attack is very unlikely to succeed and a brute force
    attack will likely take a very long time.
    Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large pool
    of characters.

            Note that <em>Upper case letters</em> are required, <em>Lowercase letters</em> are
            requested, <em>Digits</em> are required and <em>Punctuation</em> characters are
            requested and <em>Symbols</em> are required.
            The potentially confusing characters O (upper O), 0 (zero),
            I (upper I), l (lower L) and 1 (digit) are excluded.
        </small>

<p>
    Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large pool
    of characters. If the ASCII character set is chosen there will be 85
    printable characters to select from while selecting
    <a href="#extended">Extended ASCII</a> (usually referred to as ISO-8859-1 or Latin 1)
    will give 155 possible characters.
</p>

    However, a program or Web site that requires a password may not
    accept all possible characters or it may set some requirements such as
    requiring at least one upper case letter, one digit and one
    punctuation character.
    
    Using the top check boxes, it is possible to exclude, allow or require
    the following groups of characters:
    <a href="#upper"> upper case letters</a>,
    <a href="#lower">lower case letters</a>,
    <a href="#digits"> digits</a>
    and <a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>.
    These check boxes have three states.
    
    <ul>
        <li>If the checkbox is <i>unchecked</i>, that group of characters will be
            excluded from the character pool. </li>
        <li>If it is <i>fully checked</i> at least one character from the group will be in the password.</li>
        <li>If it is <i>partly checked</i>, characters from that group may appear in the password
            or they may not.</li>
    </ul>


<h3><a name="exclude"></a>Excluding specific characters</h3>
<p>You may exclude certain characters arbitrarily from the character pool. It may be that
    a Web site does not accept some characters, usually those in the punctuation group. Or,
    you may wish to avoid characters that are easily confused such as I (upper I) and l (lower L).
    Check the <b>Exclude these characters</b> to turn on this feature and enter the characters
    in the editor. Unchecking the check box will turn this off even if there are characters in
    the editor.
</p>


<h3><a name="passwordlen"></a>Password length</h3>
<p>The length of the password can be changed here. The allowed range is 8 to 30 characters.
    The default length of 16 is a good choice for most uses.
</p>

<h2><a name="clipboard">Copy to clipboard</a></h2>
<p>The default behaviour is to copy the password to the system clipboard as soon as it is
    generated. Turn this off if you do not want to do this.
</p>

<h2><a name="password">Password</a></h2>
<p>This field is read only and contains the last password that was generated. If you don't
    like it for some reason generate another. The text can be selected with
    the mouse and copied if desired.
</p>

<h2><a name="entropy">Entropy</a></h2>
<p>
    The entropy of the password is a measure of how many guesses would be necessary to guess it.
    Specifically, it is
    <code>log
        <sub>2
            </sub>n
        </code> where
    <code>n
        </code> is the number
    of possible passwords given the password length and the character pool size. This is described
    in a
    <a href=
       "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_password_generator#Type_and_strength_of_password_generated"
       target="_blank">
        Wikipedia article. </a>
    
    Password Beaver uses a 64 bit random number generator so the maximum entropy available is 64 bits.
