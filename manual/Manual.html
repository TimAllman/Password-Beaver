<h2 class="western"><a name="about"></a>About the Beaver</h2>
<p>Password Beaver is a lightweight, easy to use and secure password
generator. It creates passwords based upon random selection from the
printable characters of the ASCII character set or optionally from an
extended ASCII character set. Unwanted characters can be arbitrarily
excluded if needed. Optionally, the password is copied to the system
clipboard so that it can be pasted where it is needed. 
</p>
<p><em>Password Beaver</em> creates a character pool based upon the
user's selection of options. The pool of characters starts as the
printable characters from either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-ASCII">ASCII</a>
or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1">ISO-8859-1</a>
(the most common extended ASCII) character sets, modified by the
userâ€™s selections. It can be modified to <b>omit</b>, <b>request</b>
or <b>require</b> characters from several groups. Currently these
groups are <a href="#upper">upper case letters</a>, <a href="#lower">lower
case letters</a>, <a href="#digits">digits</a>, <a href="#symbols">symbols</a>,
and everything else which we refer to somewhat inaccurately as
<a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>. Further, an arbitrary set of
characters specified by the user can be excluded. You may want to do
this to improve readability in case the password needs to be manually
copied or perhaps to satisfy a Web site which doesn't accept some
characters in its passwords. The <a href="#length">length of the
password</a> can be set with the minimum length of 8 characters and a
maximun of 50. 
</p>
<p>The generated passwords are intended to be used with a password
manager as they are not easy for most people to remember. This makes
them harder to crack because a dictionary attack is very unlikely to
succeed and a brute force attack will likely take a very long time.
Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large
pool of characters.

confusing characters O (upper O), 0 (zero), I (upper I), l (lower L)
and 1 (digit) are excluded. </font>
</p>
<h3 class="western">Selecting characters</h3>
<p>Generally the best choice is to pick a long password from a large
pool of characters. If the ASCII character set is chosen (i.e.
Extended ASCII is <i>is </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">not
chosen) there</span></span> will be 85 printable characters to select
from while selecting <a href="#extended">Extended ASCII</a> (usually
referred to as ISO-8859-1 or Latin 1) will give 155 possible
characters.</p>
<p>However, a program or Web site that requires a password may not
accept all possible characters or it may set some requirements such
as requiring at least one upper case letter, one digit and one
punctuation character. Using the top check boxes, it is possible to
exclude, allow or require the following groups of characters: <a href="#upper">upper
case letters</a>, <a href="#lower">lower case letters</a>, <a href="#digits">digits</a>,
<a href="#symbols">symbols</a> and <a href="#punctuation">punctuation</a>.
These check boxes have three states. 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the checkbox is <i>unchecked</i>,
	that group of characters will be <strong>excluded</strong> from the
	character pool. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If it is <i>fully checked</i> at
	least one character from the group will be <b>required</b>.</p>
	<li/>
<p>If it is <i>partly checked</i>, characters from that group
	are <b>requested</b><span style="font-weight: normal">. They may</span>
	appear in the password or they may not.</p>
</ul>
<h3 class="western"><a name="exclude"></a>Excluding specific
characters</h3>
<p>You may exclude certain characters arbitrarily from the character
pool. It may be that a Web site does not accept some characters,
usually those in the punctuation group. Or, you may wish to avoid
characters that are easily confused such as I (upper I) and l (lower
L). Check <b>Exclude these characters</b> to turn on this feature and
enter the characters in the editor. Unchecking the check box will
turn this off even if there are characters in the editor.</p>
<h3 class="western">Character pool size</h3>
<p>This is the current size of the character pool from which
passwords are taken and changes as character groups are selected and
as some are excluded. This field is read only.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="passwordlen"></a>Password length</h3>
<p>The length of the password can be changed here. The allowed range
is 8 to 50 characters. The default length of 16 is a good choice for
most uses. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="clipboard"></a>Copy to clipboard</h2>
<p>The default behaviour is to copy the password to the system
clipboard as soon as it is generated. Turn this off if you do not
want to do this. The text can be selected with the mouse and copied
if desired. 
</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="password"></a>Password</h2>
<p>This field is read only and contains the last password that was
generated. If you don't like it for some reason generate another.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="entropy"></a>Entropy</h2>
<p>The entropy of the password is a measure of how many guesses would
be necessary to guess it. Specifically, it is <code class="western">log</code><code class="western"><sub>2</sub></code><code class="western">(n)
</code>where <code class="western">n </code>is the number of possible
passwords given the password length and the character pool size. This
is described in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_password_generator#Type_and_strength_of_password_generated" target="_blank">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>
<h2 class="western">Password strength</h2>
<p>A good password is hard to guess.
